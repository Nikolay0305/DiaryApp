## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Set Up the Connection String

1. **Clone** the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in Visual Studio (or your preferred IDE).
3. Locate the file named `example.json`.
4. **Rename** `example.json` to `appsettings.json`.
5. Open the new `appsettings.json` file and update your SQL Server connection string, for example:

```json
{
  "Logging": {
    "LogLevel": {
      "Default": "Information",
      "Microsoft.AspNetCore": "Warning"
    }
  },
  "AllowedHosts": "*",
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "DefaultConnection": "Server=<your-server>;Database=<your-database>;Trusted_Connection=True;TrustServerCertificate=True;"
  }
}
```

## To ensure appsettings.json is available when the application runs follow these steps:
1. Go to Solution Explorer

2. Find appsettings.json and right-click on it

3. Go to Properties and Set "Copy to Output Directory" to "Copy if newer"

4. Save and Rebuild the Solution
   


## Restore NuGet Packages

2. Right-click on the solution in Solution Explorer and click Restore NuGet Packages.

dotnet restore

4. Install required NuGet Packages
Run these commands:\
dotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer\
dotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Design\
dotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Tools\
or go to Tools -> NuGet Package Manager -> Manage NuGet Packages for Solution and search for installs.
